    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>
      Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties,
      composition, and behavior of matter. It is fascinating field that explores
      the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each
      element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe of iron, H for
      hydrogen , and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and
      periods based on their properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>
      Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's
      an example of chemical reaction.
    </p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>->2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p><b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calcuation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. In involves balancing chemical equations to
    ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
    <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent
    charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions
        that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
